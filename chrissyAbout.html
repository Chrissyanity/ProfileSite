  <h2><strong><u>Brief Bio</h2></strong></u>
      <p class="para1">  <strong>A</strong>fter working in the auto industry for five years, I decided it was right time for a career change. I began dabbling in web development when a friend and I started our concierge service in 2014 and needed a website for people to find out about our services and book them online. I found the challenge exciting and soon after found out about the diversity defeceit in Detroit's growing tech industry.</p>
      <p class="para2"><strong>W</strong>ith a little research, I found <em>Grand Circus</em> and saw it as the perfect gateway to a new career in tech. I enrolled in their Front-end Bootcamp and learned languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and many more that have prepared me for life as Front-end developer.</p>
